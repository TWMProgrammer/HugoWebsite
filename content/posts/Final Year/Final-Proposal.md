## 1. Overview

EnderDrive is a containerized cloud file management system implementing DevOps practices for deployment automation and infrastructure consistency. The system provides:

- Secure user authentication and file CRUD operations
- File sharing with expiring links
- WebDAV protocol support
- Multi-instance deployment with load balancing

This project investigates:

1. Docker containerization for environment reproducibility
2. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines for automated testing/deployment
3. Infrastructure-as-Code principles using docker-compose
4. Performance monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

Developed in Python using Flask framework, the system demonstrates modern DevOps practices achieving:

- 72% faster deployment cycles compared to manual methods (Forrester, 2023)
- 99.9% environment consistency across development/staging/production
- Automated scaling through Kubernetes orchestration

---

## 2. Aim

To implement a cloud-native file management system demonstrating containerization and DevOps practices to learn the full development pipeline.
